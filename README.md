## Repository Structure

The first folder, `simulations` contains the code necessary for running the controller with a simulation loop. 
The readme inside the folder describes how to set up and run the simulation.

The second folder, `ros_implementation` contains the two packages used in the hardware experiments. A readme inside the folder describes how to setup and run the experiments.
